Task: Write a Rust program to add and remove liquidity on Raydium.
This can be implemented either within a Smart Contract or as an external Solana interaction.

The main goal is for the AddLiquidity() and RemoveLiquidity() functions to work correctly.

(It is very important that the code is written in the RUST program).

Bonus Points: If both functions can execute in the same transaction, that would be a plus!
